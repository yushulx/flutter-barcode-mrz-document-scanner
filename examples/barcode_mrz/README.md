A Flutter project that demonstrates how to use **Dynamsoft Capture Vision** to scan **MRZ (Machine Readable Zone)** and **1D/2D barcodes** from images and camera streams.

## Getting Started
1. Apply for a [30-day trial license](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense/?product=dcv&package=cross-platform) and replace the license key in the `global.dart` file with your own:

    ```dart
    String licenseKey = "LICENSE-KEY";
    ```

2. Run the project:

    ```bash
    flutter run -d chrome
    flutter run -d windows
    flutter run 
    ```
